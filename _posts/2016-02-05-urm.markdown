Urban Risk Map uses social messaging platforms, including Twitter and Facebook to collect and coordinate hazard information from residents and disaster response agencies during flood and storm events. The platform is unique because it is real time, helping both residents and government make informed decisions during emergencies. Urban Risk Map is powered by the free and open source software [CogniCity](https://github.com/urbanriskmap).
